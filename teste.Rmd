## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r}
library(RColorBrewer)
library(pheatmap)


indi_1 <- read.csv("C:/r/9494_indicadores.csv", sep=",")
indi_1 <- indi_1[order(indi_1$CD_DEPE_UOR),]
row.names(indi_1) <- indi_1$NM_UOR_RDZ
indi_2 <- indi_1[,3:15]
indi_matrix <- data.matrix(indi_2)
pheatmap(indi_matrix, display_numbers = T, cluster_row = FALSE, cluster_cols = FALSE, cellheight = 10, cellwidth = 30)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
